# wordpress-child-plugin-tool
This tool allows you to modify a Wordpress plugin without losing the ability to update the plugin. This tool works like Wordpress child themes where you can override files that exist in the child plugin by creating a copy of the file and add files to the plugin by creating new files. You can also revert all the changes you made to the plugin.
